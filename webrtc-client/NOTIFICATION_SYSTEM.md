# Notification System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive notification system has been implemented to ensure that when meetings are scheduled, all participants are properly notified through multiple channels.

## System Architecture

### 1. **Backend Components**

#### **Notification Model** (`src/models/notification.js`)
- Stores notification data with recipient, sender, type, title, message, and metadata
- Supports different notification types: meeting_invitation, meeting_reminder, meeting_cancelled, etc.
- Includes read/unread status and timestamps
- Optimized with database indexes for efficient queries

#### **Notification Controller** (`src/controllers/notificationController.js`)
- Handles CRUD operations for notifications
- Provides functions for creating, reading, marking as read, and deleting notifications
- Includes bulk operations like marking all as read

#### **Enhanced Meeting Controller** (`src/controllers/meetingController.js`)
- Automatically creates notifications when meetings are scheduled
- Sends notifications to all participants (except the organizer)
- Includes meeting details in notification metadata
- Integrates with real-time notification system

#### **Notification Routes** (`src/routes/notification.js`)
- RESTful API endpoints for notification management
- GET `/api/notifications` - Get user's notifications
- GET `/api/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread count
- PATCH `/api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark as read
- PATCH `/api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all as read
- DELETE `/api/notifications/:id` - Delete notification

### 2. **Real-Time Communication**

#### **Socket.io Integration**
- Real-time notification delivery using WebSocket connections
- `sendNotification()` function broadcasts notifications to online users
- Notifications are sent immediately when meetings are created
- Supports browser notifications for enhanced user experience

#### **Notification Events**
- `notification:new` - Sent when a new notification is created
- Automatic browser notification display (if permission granted)
- Real-time unread count updates

### 3. **Frontend Components**

#### **Notification Service** (`src/services/notificationService.js`)
- API client functions for notification operations
- Handles all notification-related HTTP requests
- Provides clean interface for notification management

#### **Notification Context** (`src/context/NotificationContext.jsx`)
- Global state management for notifications
- Real-time notification listening
- Automatic unread count tracking
- Browser notification integration
- Provides hooks for components to access notification data

#### **Enhanced Layout Component**
- Notification bell icon in header
- Real-time unread count display
- Visual indicators for new notifications
- Separate from message notifications

## How It Works

### 1. **Meeting Scheduling Flow**

1. **User schedules meeting** → ScheduleMeetingModal submits form
2. **Backend creates meeting** → MeetingController processes request
3. **Notifications created** → For each participant, create notification record
4. **Real-time delivery** → Send notification to online participants via WebSocket
5. **Frontend updates** → NotificationContext receives real-time updates
6. **UI updates** → Notification bell shows unread count, browser notification appears

### 2. **Notification Types**

#### **Meeting Invitation**
- Triggered when a new meeting is scheduled
- Includes meeting title, organizer name, time, and location
- Contains meeting metadata for easy access

#### **Future Notification Types**
- Meeting reminders (before meeting starts)
- Meeting cancellations
- Meeting updates
- System notifications

### 3. **User Experience**

#### **Real-Time Updates**
- Instant notification delivery to online users
- No page refresh required
- Smooth animations and visual feedback

#### **Multiple Notification Channels**
- In-app notification bell with unread count
- Browser notifications (if permission granted)
- Real-time WebSocket delivery

#### **Notification Management**
- Mark individual notifications as read
- Mark all notifications as read
- Delete notifications
- Persistent notification history

## Database Schema

### **Notification Collection**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  recipient: ObjectId (ref: 'User'),
  sender: ObjectId (ref: 'User'),
  type: String (enum: ['meeting_invitation', 'meeting_reminder', ...]),
  title: String,
  message: String,
  data: Object (meeting metadata),
  read: Boolean (default: false),
  createdAt: Date (default: Date.now)
}
```

### **Indexes**
- `{ recipient: 1, read: 1, createdAt: -1 }` - Efficient queries for user notifications

## API Endpoints

### **Notifications**
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get user's notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread count
- `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark notification as read
- `PATCH /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all as read
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete notification

### **Meetings** (Enhanced)
- `POST /api/meetings` - Create meeting (now includes notification creation)
- `GET /api/meetings/upcoming` - Get upcoming meetings (includes organized meetings)

## Real-Time Events

### **Socket.io Events**
- `notification:new` - New notification received
- `user:online` - User came online
- `user:offline` - User went offline

## Frontend Integration

### **Notification Context Usage**
```javascript
import { useNotifications } from '../context/NotificationContext';

const { notifications, unreadCount, markAsRead } = useNotifications();
```

### **Real-Time Updates**
- Automatic notification reception
- Unread count updates
- Browser notification display
- UI state synchronization

## Benefits

### 1. **Immediate Awareness**
- Participants know about meetings instantly
- No need to manually check for new meetings
- Real-time updates across all connected devices

### 2. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Multiple notification channels
- Visual indicators and badges
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Intuitive notification management

### 3. **Reliability**
- Database persistence for offline users
- Real-time delivery for online users
- Fallback mechanisms for failed deliveries
- Error handling and logging

### 4. **Scalability**
- Efficient database queries with indexes
- WebSocket-based real-time communication
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Support for multiple notification types

## Future Enhancements
